### **Printable Reviewer: Genetics, Evolution, History of Evolution, and Taxonomy**  

#### **I. Genetics**  

##### **1. Predicting Genotypes and Phenotypes**  
- **Mendel’s Laws:**  
  - **Law of Segregation:** Each organism has two alleles for a trait, which separate during gamete formation.  
  - **Law of Independent Assortment:** Genes for different traits are inherited independently.  
- **Punnett Squares:** Used to predict the probability of offspring inheriting particular traits.  
- **Genotypic Ratio:** Example for monohybrid cross (1:2:1 for heterozygous parents).  
- **Phenotypic Ratio:** Example for monohybrid cross (3:1 for heterozygous parents).  

##### **2. Sex Linkage and Recombination**  
- **Sex-linked traits** (e.g., hemophilia, color blindness) are carried on the X chromosome.  
- **Males (XY) are more affected** since they have only one X chromosome.  
- **Recombination** occurs through crossing-over during meiosis, increasing genetic diversity.  

##### **3. Modifications to Mendelian Ratios**  
- **Incomplete dominance:** Blended phenotype (e.g., red + white flowers → pink).  
- **Codominance:** Both alleles are fully expressed (e.g., AB blood type).  
- **Epistasis:** One gene masks another gene’s effects.  
- **Polygenic traits:** Controlled by multiple genes (e.g., skin color).  

##### **4. Molecular Structure of DNA, RNA, and Proteins**  
- **DNA:** Double-helix, made of nucleotides (A, T, C, G).  
- **RNA:** Single-stranded, contains uracil (U) instead of thymine (T).  
- **Proteins:** Made of amino acids, determined by the sequence of mRNA.  

##### **5. DNA Replication and Protein Synthesis**  
- **Replication:** DNA unwinds, complementary base pairing occurs, producing two identical DNA strands.  
- **Transcription:** DNA → mRNA in the nucleus.  
- **Translation:** mRNA → protein in ribosomes using tRNA.  

##### **6. Genetic Engineering**  
- **Steps:**
  1. DNA is extracted.
  2. Restriction enzymes cut DNA.
  3. Recombinant DNA is inserted into a host.
  4. Transformed organisms express new genes.  

##### **7. Applications of Recombinant DNA**  
- **Medicine:** Insulin production, gene therapy.  
- **Agriculture:** Genetically modified crops for higher yields. *Bacillus thuringiensis* is used for pesticide.

#### **II. Evolution**  

##### **1. History of Life on Earth & Geologic Time Scale**  
- **Precambrian (4.6 BYA–540 MYA):** First life forms (bacteria).  
- **Paleozoic Era:** Early fish, amphibians, and first plants.  
- **Mesozoic Era:** Age of dinosaurs, first mammals.  
- **Cenozoic Era:** Modern mammals and humans evolve.  

##### **2. Mechanisms of Evolution**  
- **Natural Selection:** Survival of the fittest.  
- **Genetic Drift:** Random allele frequency changes.  
- **Mutation:** Source of genetic variation.  
- **Recombination:** Shuffles genes, creating diversity.  

##### **3. Descent with Modification**  
- **All species share common ancestors** and have evolved through gradual changes.  

##### [**4. Development of Evolutionary Thought**](#evolutionary-theories-and-contributors)
- **Lamarck:** Inheritance of acquired traits (disproven).  
- **Darwin:** Natural selection as the primary mechanism of evolution.  

##### **5. Evidence of Evolution**  
- **Fossil Record:** Shows changes in organisms over time.  
- **Biogeography:** Similar species found in different parts of the world.  
- **Homology:** Similar body structures due to common ancestry.  
- **Embryology:** Similarities in embryos suggest relatedness.  

##### **6. Inferring Evolutionary Relationships**  
- **Phylogenetic trees:** Show relationships based on shared characteristics.  
- **DNA/Protein Analysis:** More similar sequences = closer relation.

##### **Evolutionary Theories and Contributors**  

**1. Aristotle (384–322 BCE)**  
- **Hypothesis**: Believed in the "Scala Naturae" (Great Chain of Being), where organisms are arranged in a hierarchy from simple to complex forms.  
- **Contribution**: His classification of organisms laid the foundation for later taxonomic work.  

**2. Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778)**  
- **Hypothesis**: Developed binomial nomenclature, classifying organisms based on physical characteristics.  
- **Contribution**: Created the system of taxonomy still used today, influencing evolutionary studies by grouping organisms based on similarities.  

**3. Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (1707–1788)**  
- **Hypothesis**: Suggested that species could change over time due to environmental influences.  
- **Contribution**: One of the first to propose that species are not fixed and can evolve.  

 **4. Georges Cuvier (1769–1832)**  
- **Hypothesis**: Developed catastrophism, the idea that species go extinct due to sudden catastrophic events.  
- **Contribution**: Showed that fossils represent extinct organisms, supporting the idea of change in biodiversity over time.  

 **5. James Hutton (1726–1797)**  
- **Hypothesis**: Proposed gradualism—the Earth changes slowly over long periods.  
- **Contribution**: His ideas influenced the understanding of deep time, which is necessary for evolution.  

 **6. Charles Lyell (1797–1875)**  
- **Hypothesis**: Advocated for uniformitarianism, which states that Earth's processes occur at a consistent rate over time.  
- **Contribution**: Provided geological evidence that supported the long timescales needed for evolution.  

 **7. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829)**  
- **Hypothesis**: Proposed that organisms evolve through the inheritance of acquired characteristics (e.g., giraffes stretching their necks).  
- **Contribution**: Though incorrect, he was one of the first to suggest that species change over time.  

 **8. Charles Darwin (1809–1882)**  
- **Hypothesis**: Developed natural selection as the mechanism of evolution—organisms with favorable traits survive and reproduce.  
- **Contribution**: Published *On the Origin of Species* (1859), revolutionizing evolutionary biology.  

 **9. Alfred Russel Wallace (1823–1913)**  
- **Hypothesis**: Independently conceived natural selection based on observations in Southeast Asia.  
- **Contribution**: His work pushed Darwin to publish his own findings.

##### **Development of the Theory of Evolution**  
1. **Early Ideas** – Aristotle and Linnaeus focused on classification, without suggesting evolution.  
2. **First Evolutionary Thoughts** – Buffon and Lamarck proposed species change over time.  
3. **Fossil and Geological Evidence** – Cuvier, Hutton, and Lyell demonstrated Earth’s long history and changes in species.
