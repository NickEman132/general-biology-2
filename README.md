### **Printable Reviewer: Genetics, Evolution, and Taxonomy**  

#### **I. Genetics**  

##### **1. Predicting Genotypes and Phenotypes**  
- **Mendel’s Laws:**  
  - **Law of Segregation:** Each organism has two alleles for a trait, which separate during gamete formation.  
  - **Law of Independent Assortment:** Genes for different traits are inherited independently.  
- **Punnett Squares:** Used to predict the probability of offspring inheriting particular traits.  
- **Genotypic Ratio:** Example for monohybrid cross (1:2:1 for heterozygous parents).  
- **Phenotypic Ratio:** Example for monohybrid cross (3:1 for heterozygous parents).  

##### **2. Sex Linkage and Recombination**  
- **Sex-linked traits** (e.g., hemophilia, color blindness) are carried on the X chromosome.  
- **Males (XY) are more affected** since they have only one X chromosome.  
- **Recombination** occurs through crossing-over during meiosis, increasing genetic diversity.  

##### **3. Modifications to Mendelian Ratios**  
- **Incomplete dominance:** Blended phenotype (e.g., red + white flowers → pink).  
- **Codominance:** Both alleles are fully expressed (e.g., AB blood type).  
- **Epistasis:** One gene masks another gene’s effects.  
- **Polygenic traits:** Controlled by multiple genes (e.g., skin color).  

##### **4. Molecular Structure of DNA, RNA, and Proteins**  
- **DNA:** Double-helix, made of nucleotides (A, T, C, G).  
- **RNA:** Single-stranded, contains uracil (U) instead of thymine (T).  
- **Proteins:** Made of amino acids, determined by the sequence of mRNA.  

##### **5. DNA Replication and Protein Synthesis**  
- **Replication:** DNA unwinds, complementary base pairing occurs, producing two identical DNA strands.  
- **Transcription:** DNA → mRNA in the nucleus.  
- **Translation:** mRNA → protein in ribosomes using tRNA.  

##### **6. Genetic Engineering**  
- **Steps:**
  1. DNA is extracted.
  2. Restriction enzymes cut DNA.
  3. Recombinant DNA is inserted into a host.
  4. Transformed organisms express new genes.  

##### **7. Applications of Recombinant DNA**  
- **Medicine:** Insulin production, gene therapy.  
- **Agriculture:** Genetically modified crops for higher yields.

#### **II. Evolution**  

##### **1. History of Life on Earth & Geologic Time Scale**  
- **Precambrian (4.6 BYA–540 MYA):** First life forms (bacteria).  
- **Paleozoic Era:** Early fish, amphibians, and first plants.  
- **Mesozoic Era:** Age of dinosaurs, first mammals.  
- **Cenozoic Era:** Modern mammals and humans evolve.  

##### **2. Mechanisms of Evolution**  
- **Natural Selection:** Survival of the fittest.  
- **Genetic Drift:** Random allele frequency changes.  
- **Mutation:** Source of genetic variation.  
- **Recombination:** Shuffles genes, creating diversity.  

##### **3. Descent with Modification**  
- **All species share common ancestors** and have evolved through gradual changes.  

##### **4. Development of Evolutionary Thought**  
- **Lamarck:** Inheritance of acquired traits (disproven).  
- **Darwin:** Natural selection as the primary mechanism of evolution.  

##### **5. Evidence of Evolution**  
- **Fossil Record:** Shows changes in organisms over time.  
- **Biogeography:** Similar species found in different parts of the world.  
- **Homology:** Similar body structures due to common ancestry.  
- **Embryology:** Similarities in embryos suggest relatedness.  

##### **6. Inferring Evolutionary Relationships**  
- **Phylogenetic trees:** Show relationships based on shared characteristics.  
- **DNA/Protein Analysis:** More similar sequences = closer relation.

#### **III. Taxonomy & Classification**  

##### **1. Structural and DNA Evidence in Classification**  
- **Morphology & Anatomy:** Physical similarities.  
- **DNA Comparisons:** Closer genetic similarity = closer relation.  

##### **2. Unique Characteristics of Taxa**  
- **Domain:** Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya.  
- **Kingdoms:** Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Bacteria.  

##### **3. Species Diversity and Cladistics**  
- **Cladograms** show evolutionary relationships.  
- **Classification based on shared traits and DNA similarities.**
